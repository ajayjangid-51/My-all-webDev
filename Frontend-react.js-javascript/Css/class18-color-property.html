<!-- yaha pe apan CSS meh "COLOR property" k bareh meh dekhenge, jaise ki color property or bhi dusri property meh use hoti hai as like in "background-color" color is set, for "border" also color is set
SO mainly COLOR property ki value set krne ya color dene k 3 ways hai:
  1.simply by writing the name of color,
  2.by setting the rgb value of the color (here rgb stand for (red,green,blue) respectively and value of each lies in btwn 0 to 256 toh simply sabhi ki value set ki jati hai as like (34,0,54) and combine color will be the result)
  3.by setting the hex value of the color (hex value of any color is simply given by "#2342ff" and apan google se bhi color ki hex value search krke apply kr skte hai) -->
